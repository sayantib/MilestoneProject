This project has the following components:
1. Clone the Flask Demo repository.
2. Create a Flask app on Heroku that accepts a stock ticker input front the user and creates a Bokeh plot of the closing price data for the last month. This data is obtained by accessing the Quandle WIKI dataset via API.
